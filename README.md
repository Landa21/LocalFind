# 📍 Local Experience Finder

**Uncover Hidden Gems. Local Stories Await.**

Local Experience Finder is a platform designed to bridge the gap between curious explorers and the heartbeat of South Africa. From family-owned art studios in the Bo-Kaap to secret hiking trails in the Drakensberg, this app curates authentic, community-driven experiences that you won't find in a standard guidebook.
